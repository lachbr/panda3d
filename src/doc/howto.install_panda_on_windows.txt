                ---------------------------------------
                HOW TO INSTALL PANDA3D ON WINXP/WIN2000
                ---------------------------------------

*********************************************************************
  NOTES
*********************************************************************

  - Lines preceeded by ">" are instructions to be typed on the command 
    line.
  - Make sure your system clock is not set to GMT (only worry about 
    this if your makedepend seems out of sync, i.e. you constantly 
    reinstall old files over more current ones).
  - "Touch" doesn't quite work properly currently (is this still true?).
  - Make sure your machine has enough disk space - I'd start with the 
    largest open space on any of your partitions.
    You will have the fewest headaches if you choose C:\ for everything.
    Also make sure that you're logged into your computer with the same
    username as your unix account because Cygwin will get its USER 
    variable from the windows username.
  - Ensure your computer's date is set correctly, or else the 
    compilation scripts may have problems later.
    
*********************************************************************
  Step 1: Map network drive to build tools drive
*********************************************************************

  - Right click on Network Places, choose Map Network Drive
  - Map Network Drive P: to \\mover\vol02\dimbo\usr2\panda (using your
    unix password)
    You also can do this from cmd.exe using 
      > net use p: \\mover\vol02\dimbo\usr2\panda /persistent:yes
  - Select 'Reconnect drive at startup'
  - If this doesn't work, you can install the build tools from CD
  - Run 'regedit P:\tabs.reg' to enable tab-filename-completion.
    You must exit and restart the cmd.exe shell to enable this, since 
    the registry is only read at cmd.exe startup.
    
*********************************************************************
  Step 2: Update OS software
*********************************************************************

  - On Win2000, install ServicePack 3 and DX 8.1 by running (unless you
    already have DX 8 or greater)
    > P:\win2k-servicepack3.exe
    > P:\dx8.1\DX81NTeng.exe

    or download them from http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/ 
      (this will be MUCH slower).

  - On both WinXP and Win2000, I recommend you go to 
    http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/, click on 'Product Updates' 
    (installing the Product Update ActiveX control), and install any
    patches labeled 'Critical Updates' as well as any updated sound,
    network, and motherboard drivers.  Video card manufacturers will
    usually have newer drivers than the WindowsUpdate site, however, so
    go to the manufacturer's website to check for win2000/winXP
    drivers, especially on win2000, since the original win2k CD drivers
    are most likely obsolete.

*********************************************************************
  Step 3: Install Visual C++
*********************************************************************

  - MS Visual C++ requires MS Internet Information Server so this must
    be installed prior to installing MSVC.
  - Click on Start->Settings->Control Panel
  - Click on Add/Remove Programs
  - On the left side of the window, select Add/Remove Windows Components
  - Check the box next to Internet Information Services (IIS)
  - Click the Details button
  - Check FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions
  - Click OK
  - Click Next
  - Click Finish when done

  - Run P:\msvs7_1\VS\SETUP.EXE, or install from the MSDN 
    'Visual Studio.NET 2003' CD. Click on 'Windows Component Update' 
    (if it is highlighted, else click '2').  Click 'Continue' 
    (Selecting 'Do not use this machine to host web projects').  

  - After installing components, you are ready to install VC7.1 in .NET 
    setup Step 2. Enter this step and enter "VR Studio" for the username.
    On the 'Select items to install page', you need uncheck things to
    avoid wasting gigs of extra space and install time.  

  - Uncheck everything except for:
    - Language Tools->Visual C++
    - Server Components->Remote Debugger->Native Remote Debugger

    And if you want:
    - Documentation (this takes a gig, and is only a slight 
      update if you already have MSDN installed locally.  
      You will want to uninstall any separately-installed 
      MSDN docs if you get this.)
    
*********************************************************************
  Step 4: Install Cygwin (v1.3.5 or above should work)
*********************************************************************

  - Latest version currently is 1.5.18-1 (as of Dec 20, 2005)
  - As of 1.3.11, cygwin seems stable enough to install from the 
    internet, go to http://cygwin.com and click on "install cygwin now"
  - The most reliable download server is http://mirrors.rcn.net. 
    Another server is http://sigunix.cwrv.edu. 
  - Make sure that the following packages are selected for installation:
      - Under Archive : zip, unzip
      - Under Devel packages :  bison, CVS, make, flex
      - Under Interpreters : gawk, perl (see note below)
      - Under Network : openssh, openssl
      - Under Shells : ash, bash, tcsh
      - Under Text : more (or less)
  - You can also install other programs (like vi) if you want.  
    To rotate through the possible installation options, left-click on 
    the programs of your choice.
  - DO NOT INSTALL the following packages (change the Setting to 
    "SKIP"):
      - emacs/xemacs, we have our own emacs (see Step 10) 
      - The Interpreter->python package 
      - Remove X-windows packages to make download smaller.
  - There are many subpackages that are obviously not needed 
    (e.g. Mail, Doc, Text, Games) that you can skip if you like.
  - Create a desktop shortcut or Start Menu item for
    c:\cygwin\bin\tcsh.exe and use it in the future.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE:
    The known issues section pertains to older versions of Cygwin and 
    versions of software it installs by default.  If you installed 
    Cygwin version 1.5.10 (CYGWIN_NT-5.1) or newer you can probably 
    ignore the following.

    Type uname -a in your cygwin tcsh window to check version number.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Known Problems with tcsh:
      tcsh v6.09.00: (cygwin 1.0)   
      - long paths result in 'Word too long' errors, especially during 
        panda "attach" scripts

      tcsh v.6.11 - 6.12.00
      - TAB filename completion sometimes fails on second+ arguments in 
        cmdline (e.g. "cp file.cxx file2[TAB]" fails to complete 
        file2.cxx).
        To fix this, go to /etc/profile.d/complete.tcsh and comment out 
        the lines associated with "complete mv" and "complete cp"
       
      v6.09 and v6.11 should be stored on P:\cygwin-1.3.5, you can copy 
        them to c:\cygwin\bin if you want to use them
    
    Known Problems with bash:
      - None :)

    Known Problems with perl version 5.8.0-2 installed by default w/ 
      older Cygwin install, check perl version with "perl -V" in your 
      cygwin shell:

      This is not compatible with the current $DTOOL startup script 
      $DTOOL/etc/dtool.cshrc install: specifically the 
      "source $SETUP_SCRIPT" because cygwin Perl 5.8.0 leaves a ^M 
      newline in the variable, screwing up the later source 
      $SETUP_SCRIPT resulting in startup errors.  Stay
      with earlier versions of Perl (5.6.x) or later versions of Perl,
      starting with version 5.8.0-3
               
    Next, you can run a bash shell by going to the "Start"
    button at the bottom left of your screen, selecting "Programs",
    "Cygwin" and "bash".  You can then run "tcsh" at the bash prompt 
    to make things easier.  To make things really easy, edit 
    C:\Cygwin\cygwin.bat, change "bash --login -i" to "tcsh -i", 
    this will cause tcsh to be the default shell when you start 
    Cygwin command prompt/shell.  

*********************************************************************
  Step 5: Create your HOME directory
*********************************************************************

  - Add C:\Cygwin\bin to the $path environment variable in the registry 
    to avoid errors (sed: Command not found) when executing the file 
    complete.tcsh (in C:\Cygwin\etc\profile.d) on startup
    - Note: You must be logged into an account with Administrator access
	- Select "Start Menu->Control Panel"
	- Select "System" icon.
	- Select "Advanced->Environment" button.
	- Scroll down to the Path environment variable in the System
	  variables section, select it and click the Edit button
	- Add "C:\cygwin\bin" to the end of the semicolon delimited list
	- Click OK - OK - OK to exit
    
  - Launch the Cygwin command prompt/shell (tcsh) using the icon set up
    in Step 4
    
  - Create a HOME directory:
      > mkdir /<home root>/<login>
    where <home root> can be either "usr" or "home", and <login> is
    the name you use to login to your Windows machine.
   
    Note: In Windows this directory will be the equivalent of:    
      C:\cygwin\<home root>\<login>

  - Set the $HOME environment variable in the Registry:
    - Note: You must be logged into an account with Administrator access
    - Select "Start Menu->Control Panel"
    - Select "System" icon.
    - Select "Advanced->Environment" button.
    - Create the variable "HOME" with the value:
         "c:\cygwin\<home root>\<login>".
    - Click OK - OK - OK to exit (you must exit for the change to take 
      effect)
    - Now open a new shell so the registry is read by the shell to get 
      the changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE: 
      We've seen a problem where we can't source ~/.cshrc if the 
      <login> in your HOME directory does not match the user name 
      %USERNAME% windows env var. To be safe, be sure your <login>
      matches your Windows login as part of your HOME directory name.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Copy important startup files into your home directory:
    > cd P:/win/install/wintools/panda
    > cp .cshrc .emacs Config.prc Config.pp /<home root>/<login>
    > cd $HOME

  - Make sure the contents of .cshrc are correct for your setup.  In 
    particular, make sure the definition for PANDA_ROOT matches the 
    directory you have installed Cygwin to (normally C:\Cygwin), 
    and that CVSROOT is correct for your CVS login (if $USERNAME 
    is not the same as your CVS/Unix account name, edit the 
    variable as necessary).

*********************************************************************
  Step 6: Set up the Cygwin environment:
*********************************************************************

  - All of the commands below have been collected in    
    P:\win\install\wintools\etc\setup2.csh.  To do all the Cygwin 
    steps below automatically, from the tcsh prompt do:
    > cd P:/win/install/wintools/etc
    > source setup2.csh

---------------------------------------------------------------------
  CAUTION: setup2.csh: 
  Some of the drives may need to be mapped manually from windows. If you
  have a cdrom or some other drive mapped to the following drives, 
  you need to unmount those and map to some other drives.  See the 
  "Connect the network drives" segment below
---------------------------------------------------------------------

  These are the steps setup2.csh performs (so you don't have to):
  - Make the following directories (don't worry if they already exist)
      > mkdir /bin /etc/ /tmp /usr
      > mkdir /c /f /g /h /i /j /p
      > mkdir /usr/local /usr/local/bin /usr/local/etc
      
  - Rename any cygwin-installed python.exe (if it exists) to avoid 
    conflicts with required VRSTUDIO-compiled python, which is 
    custom-built to load "sitecustomize.py" which sets up the 
    PYTHONPATH env-var for our panda environment:
      > mv /bin/python.exe /bin/python-cygwin.exe

    This is only necessary if you installed python while installing
    Cygwin

  - Create some links expected by the attach scripts, which look in 
    standard modern unix BSD-style places:
      > ln -s /bin/tcsh /bin/csh
      > ln -s /bin/perl /usr/local/bin/perl
      > ln -s /bin/bash /usr/local/bin/bash

  - Connect the network drives:
    Note that any of your drive letters are already in use (by a 
    CD drive, or by some I.S. login-script-created drive), you simply 
    do a 'net use' to a different drive letter, then change the 'mount' 
    command to point the official '/[drivelet]' dir at the real drive 
    letter it's mounted to.

    It is not necessary for cygwin's /p to point to the P: drive in 
    Windows.

      > net use f: "\\mover\vol01\fat\usr2" /persistent:yes
      > net use g: "\\mover\vol01\fat\bit" /persistent:yes
      > net use h: "\\mover\vol02\dimbo\usr2" /persistent:yes
      > net use i: "\\mover\vol01\fat\big" /persistent:yes
      > net use p: "\\mover\vol02\dimbo\usr2\panda" /persistent:yes

    The "net use" commands may require you to enter a password if 
    access is denied, in which case you can add the /USER:[username] 
    argument to net use and it will ask for a password.  
      See "net use /help" for more info.  
    
    The "Map Networked Drive" GUI option can be used instead of 
    "net use".

  - Create cygwin mount directories.  The purpose of this is to shorten 
    and simplify paths.  Note the use of -b for the mounts to mapped 
    network drivers on remote machines. The /ms* mounts assume things 
    were installed in C:\Program Files:
      > mount -s c:/ /c
      > mount -s -b f:/ /f
      > mount -s -b g:/ /g
      > mount -s -b h:/ /h
      > mount -s -b i:/ /i
      > mount -s -b j:/ /j
      > mount -s -b p:/ /p

    If VC7.1 is installed:
      > mkdir /msvc71
      > mount -s C:/Program\ Files/Microsoft\ Visual\ Studio .NET\ 2003 /msvc71

    If VC7 is installed:
      > mkdir /msvc7
      > mount -s C:/Program\ Files/Microsoft\ Visual\ Studio .NET /msvc7

    If VC6 is installed:
      > mkdir /msvc98 /mscommon /mspsdk
      > mount -s C:/Program\ Files/Microsoft\ Visual\ Studio/VC98 /msvc98
      > mount -s C:/Program\ Files/Microsoft\ Visual\ Studio/Common /mscommon
      > mount -s C:/Program\ Files/Microsoft\ Platform\ Sdk /mspsdk
         
    If Intel C++ is installed:
      > mkdir /intel /ia32
      > mount -s C:/Program\ Files/Intel /intel
      > mount -s C:/Program\ Files/Intel/Compiler60/IA32 /ia32

*********************************************************************
  Step 7:  Testing VC7.1 environment in shell
*********************************************************************

  - After finishing this process, make sure you are using VC7.1 in your
    shell by typing 'cl' at the prompt.  If you have VC7.1 you will see: 
    
    Microsoft (R) 32-bit C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 13.10.3077 for 80x86
    Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation 1984-2002. All rights reserved.
    
    If you have VC7, you will see:
    
    Microsoft (R)32-bit C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 13.00.9466 for 80x86 
    Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation 1984-2001.

  - If this does not work, check your tcsh path to make sure it has 
    the .NET dirs in it, and make sure the cygwin softlink mount 
    point /msvc71 exists, and is not empty but points to the proper VC7 
    directory. Doing 'ls /msvc71' should give you something like

	Common7/                                                 Visual Studio SDKs/
	EnterpriseFrameworks/                                    contents.htm
	SDK/                                                     readme.htm
	Setup/                                                   sqlserver/
	Vc7/                                                     toc.htm
	Visual Studio .NET Enterprise Developer 2003 - English/


  - If it does not, try running 
      > source ~/player/wintools/etc/setup2.csh
    again to get it to do the cmd (ignore file-exists errors)
      > mount -s C:/Program\ Files/Microsoft\ Visual\ Studio\ .NET\ 2003 /msvc7
    This should create the softlink mount, or you can just run the 
    cmd manually yourself.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
  NOTE:
  	If you installed Microsoft's .NET Framework (from Windows Update, for
  	example) before installing Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003, you may
  	experience a problem when compiling C code.  The short 8.3 file name
  	for the VC7.1 directory used by some configuration scripts is MICROS~1.NET.
  	If Microsoft's .NET Framework is installed first it will take MICROS~1.NET
  	as its 8.3 name and VC7.1 will be MICROS~2.NET.  To correct this, move
  	both directories out of the Program Files directory, then move VC back
  	first, followed by .NET Framework.  This should rename VC's 8.3 filename
  	to MICROS~1.NET.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*********************************************************************
  Step 8: Copy files needed by attach scripts
*********************************************************************

  - Run script to copy vspec files from $WINTOOLS to /usr/local/etc
    > cd /p/win/install/wintools
    > ./cp_vspec 

  To setup a new user in panda environment files:
  - If you are setting up a new user, edit the *.vspec files in 
    /usr/local/etc to add the new username and path to the player tree 
    (starting with dtool.vspec, panda.vspec, direct.vspec, otp.vspec, 
    toontown.vspec, and ttpublish.vspec).
  - (Optional) Update default values in vspec files. Edit appropriate 
    *.vspec files to specify which trees you wish to use as a default 
    (e.g. install, personal, or release)

*********************************************************************
  Step 9: Install Bison
*********************************************************************

    *** Skip this is you have bison 1.35 or greater installed. ***

    Versions of bison between 1.30-1.34 seem to have a bug, to 
    avoid this you can install bison manually:
    > cd /
    > tar zxvf /p/Cygwin-1.3.5/bison-1.28-1.tar.gz

*********************************************************************
  Step 10: Install Emacs   
*********************************************************************

  - We use GNU emacs (21.3 currently) by default, other versions of 
    emacs may also work.  Note: unlike xemacs.exe compiled for cygwin, 
    this emacs does not use Cygwin paths, so "/" represents the real 
    root (C:\, not "C:\Cygwin")).  
  - Copy the gzipped tarball to your local machine
    > cp /p/emacs-21.3-fullbin-i386.tar.gz /c
  - Ungzip, untar and install (This will install emacs into C:/emacs-21.3, do 
    not attempt to install it under a directory containing a space,
    like "Program Files".)
    > cd /c
    > gzip -d emacs-21.3-fullbin-i386.tar.gz
    > tar xvf emacs-21.3-fullbin-i386.tar
    > cp P:/win/install/direct/src/directscripts/python-mode.el /c/emacs-21.3/lisp/progmodes
    > cp P:/win/install/direct/src/directscripts/flashparen.el /c/emacs-21.3/lisp/progmodes
    > cp P:/win/install/direct/src/directscripts/runPythonEmacs /usr/local/bin
  - Update environment variables (win2000/XP).  Note: You should only 
    need to do this if you intend to invoke Emacs from a non-Cygwin 
    prompt.  If you will always be using Cygwin, simply edit your 
    .cshrc file to add the following to your path there:
       /c/emacs-21.3/bin
    - Select "Start Menu->Control Panel"
    - Select "System" icon.
    - Select "Advanced->Environment" button.
    - double click on the "Path" variable in the bottom pane 
      (system variables)
    - add "C:\emacs-21.3\bin" to the end of the path (semicolon 
      separated)
    - click ok - ok - ok to exit (you must exit for the change to take
      effect)


---------------------------------------------------------------------
 NOTE: 
   THE FOLLOWING STEPS ARE ONLY REQUIRED IF YOU WANT YOUR OWN PERSONAL
   COPY OF THE SOURCE TREES
---------------------------------------------------------------------

*********************************************************************
  Step 11: (Optional) Grab the cvs trees 
*********************************************************************

  - Open a new shell

  - Create personal trees:
    > mkdir ~/player
    > cd ~/player

  - Grab from local repository

    Make sure your CVSROOT is set to the local repository, echo $CVSROOT
    in your shell, it should return 

      :ext:<username>@mover:/cvs 

    where <username> is your Unix login name (not necessarily your
    Windows login name), check your .cshrc for the environment
    variable setting

    > cvs co otp (only if local toontown will be built)
    > cvs co toontown (only if local toontown will be built)
    > cvs co wintools (only if local wintools will be used)     
    > cvs co pandatool (only if local pandatool will be built)
    > cvs co ttmodels (only if local ttmodels will be built)
    > cvs co otp_servers_built (only if local otp_server will be run)     


  - Now choose either A (commit) or B (anonymous) access:

    A. SOURCEFORGE DEVELOPER (WITH COMMIT) ACCESS

      1. setup an account with SourceForge at 
        http://sourceforge.net/account/register.php
        Try to use the same username used your cygwin setup.  If you are
        unable to do so just make sure you edit your .cshrc file to 
        reflect this for the SFROOT variable.

        Tell somebody like David Rose or Dave Schuyler to add your 
        new sourceforge username to the list of Panda3D developers.

      2. setup ssh access cvs.sourceforge.net

        - If you have not generated a key before on another machine,
          generate a dsa key now with:

          > ssh-keygen -t dsa

          Just press enter if prompted for password.

          (If you have generated this key before, copy the id_dsa and
          id_dsa.pub from ~/.ssh on your other machine.)

          If the above does not put a file in ~/.ssh, check that
          your /etc/passwd file has an entry for your username and that
          it points to the correct home directory for you (e.g. /home/<username> ).

        - Register your generated ssh public key (id_dsa.pub) at 
          https://sourceforge.net/account/editsshkeys.php

      3. check that your .cshrc file has the SFROOT variable set to be something like this:

          setenv SFROOT :ext:<your-sourceforge-username>@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/panda3d

    B. ANONYMOUS CVS (READ-ONLY ACCESS) FROM SOURCEFORGE

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Anonymous access from SourceForge now appears to be reliable enough
     for day-to-day use.  (In the past, this has been poor to intolerable,
     but SourceForge has installed new hardware recently and claims to have
     fixed their anonymous cvs access issues.  It appears to be true.)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------

      1. Set handy environment variable to use in anonymous checkout
          > setenv SFROOT :ext:anonymous@nit:/cvsroot/panda3d

  
  NOW FOR BOTH SOURCEFORGE DEVELOPERS AND ANONYMOUS USERS:
   
  - Check out these trees
     > cvs -d $SFROOT co dtool (only if local dtool will be built)
     > cvs -d $SFROOT co panda (only if local panda will be built)
     > cvs -d $SFROOT co direct (only if local direct will be built)
     
  - Choose which optimize level you want. This is set in Config.pp in
    your $HOME directory.  Look for #define OPTIMIZE and follow
    instructions above that.  You can only choose an arbitrary
    optimize level if you are building your own DTOOL and PANDA;
    otherwise, you must set it to the optimize level corresponding to
    the version of DTOOL/PANDA you intend to attach to (install is
    built OPTIMIZE 2, release is built OPTIMIZE 3).  
    A good choice is OPTIMIZE 3.

  - Your normal, non-SourceForge CVSROOT should be set to the default:
    > setenv CVSROOT :ext:<your-unix-username>@mover:/cvs

*********************************************************************
  Step 12: (Optional) Build $DTOOL
*********************************************************************

  - When you opened a new shell in step 6, it should have attached to 
    DTOOL:install automatically, but you will need to attach to your 
    own DTOOL if you want to build your own.
    > cta dtool personal  
    > cd $DTOOL
    > ppremake
    > make install

  - Note: if you get an error stating that 'ppremake' cannot be found,
    make sure that you are attached to WINTOOLS:install and try again.
    You may need to check out a personal copy of WINTOOLS and attach
    to that in your .cshrc file before this will work.

  After the make is done successfully, modify your .cshrc file so the
  following lines look like this:

	# Generic settings
	setenv DTOOL /home/cbrunner/player/dtool
	source $DTOOL/built/etc/dtool.cshrc personal
	cta wintools personal  
  
  Open another Cygwin window using your shortcut from before and make
  sure everything starts up OK before killing the old window and proceding.

  - Note all these "cta" attach commands can be placed in your .cshrc

*********************************************************************
  Step 13: (Optional) Build $PANDA 
*********************************************************************

  - Build panda
    > cta dtool personal  
    > cta panda personal
    > cd $PANDA
    > ppremake
    > make install

  - Again, after every make, kill and reopen the tcsh window.

  - You can now run "pview" to test the install and build - you should
    see a window pop up with a triangle in it.  To see the triangle with
    a texture on it, you'll need to be in $PANDA/src/testbed/ when
    you run "pview".

*********************************************************************
  Step 14: (Optional) Build $DIRECT
*********************************************************************

  > cta dtool personal  
  > cta panda personal
  > cta direct personal
  > cd $DIRECT
  > ppremake
  > make install

*********************************************************************
  Step 15: (Optional) Build $OTP
*********************************************************************

  > cta dtool personal
  > cta panda personal
  > cta direct personal
  > cta otp personal
  > cd $OTP
  > ppremake
  > make install
  Exit the shell and create a new one

*********************************************************************
  Step 16: (Optional) Build $TOONTOWN
*********************************************************************

  > cta dtool personal  
  > cta panda personal
  > cta direct personal
  > cta otp personal
  > cta toontown personal
  > cd $TOONTOWN
  > ppremake
  > make install
  Exit the shell and create a new one
  
*********************************************************************
  Step 17: (Optional) Build $PANDATOOL
*********************************************************************

  > cta dtool personal  
  > cta panda personal
  > cta direct personal
  > cta otp personal (optional)
  > cta toontown personal (optional)
  > cta pandatool personal
  > cd $PANDATOOL
  > ppremake
  > make install
  Exit the shell and create a new one
  
*********************************************************************
  Step 18: (Optional) Build $TTMODELS
*********************************************************************

  > cta dtool personal  
  > cta panda personal
  > cta direct personal
  > cta otp personal
  > cta toontown personal
  > cta pandatool personal
  > cta ttmodels personal
  > cd $TTMODELS
  > ppremake
  > make install
  Exit the shell and create a new one
  
NOTE: You need to make sure you have a licensing solution for the various
modeling apps involved in building Toontown models (e.g. C:\FlexLM).

NOTE: It may be easier (and much less time consuming) to checkout a pre-built
version of the model tree.  The checkout_built.sh script is in
$WINTOOLS/built/bin.
  > cd ~/player
  > checkout_built.sh ttmodels
This will create a ttmodels directory with all the models already built for you.

*********************************************************************
  Step 19: (Optional) Generate Python Code
*********************************************************************

  > genPyCode
  > genPyCode -n (for publishes)

*********************************************************************
  Step 20: (Optional) Set up a local server
*********************************************************************

  - Copy local.par.example to local.par:
    > cd ~/player/otp_servers_built/windows_intel_32/bin
    > cp local.par.example local.par
  - Edit local.par and modify the file locations listed to the correct paths
    (This may just involve changing "username" to your unix username)
  - Edit local.par and uncomment one of the following lines corresponding
    to the project being used:
	  
	ADDKEY=TOONTOWN_DEV
	#ADDKEY=PIRATES_DEV
	#ADDKEY=ALL_DEV
  
  - To run the server, simply execute otp_server.exe. It would be best to
    run this in its own window.

*********************************************************************
  Step 21: (Optional) Launch a local Toontown Server and Client
*********************************************************************

  - Add the following lines to your Config.prc file in $HOME if they are
    not already there.
    
      account-old-auth 1
      verify-ssl 0
      dc-multiple-inheritance 1
      want-otp-server 1
      
  - To start the Toontown Uberdog server, first start up Python Emacs
    > runPythonEmacs
  - In Emacs launch a Python shell
    > Alt-x   (This will bring up an Emacs minibuffer line)
    > py-shell
  - From the Python command line type the following:
    > from toontown.uberdog.Start import *
  - This will start a Toontown uberdog server
  - To start the Toontown AI server, start up another Python Emacs session
    > runPythonEmacs
  - In Emacs launch a Python shell
    > Alt-x
    > py-shell
  - From the Python command line type the following:
    > from toontown.ai.AIStart import *
  - This will start a Toontown game (AI) server
  - To start a client, you will need to open yet another Python Emacs session.
    From the cygwin command prompt, type:
    > runPythonEmacs
  - In Emacs launch another Python shell as before
    > Alt-x
    > py-shell
  - In this Python command prompt, enter:
    > from toontown.toonbase.ToontownStart import *
  - After the servers and the client have started up, the game should
    prompt to create an account.  After the account is created the
    game will run as normal, but locally.
