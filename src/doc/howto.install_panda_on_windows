To install Panda3D on WinNT or Win98:
-------------------------------------
Notes:
  Lines preceeded by ">" are instructions to be typed on the command line. 
  On WinNT, make sure your system clock is not set to GMT (only worry about
    this if your makedepend seems out of sync, i.e. you constantly reinstall
    old files over more current ones).
  Opengl appears to be installed with the os for both WinNT and Win98, but I
    read somewhere that we might want to do our own version control for
    this eventually using "VerInstallFile" to install our own version of
    OpenGl.
  "Touch" doesn't quite work properly on WinNT or Win98 currently.
  Make sure you run ftp in "binary" mode to fetch tarballs.
  "ftp" doesn't currently read "backspace" in rxvt, so you'll just have to be
    precise at the ftp prompt for now ("delete" doesn't work either).
    If this really bugs you, you can create a shortcut on the Desktop to
    "tcsh.exe" and run ftp properly from there rather than from rxvt.
  Occasionally, a freshly opened shell will hang in the middle of attaching
    or something.  If this happens, go ahead and kill the tcsh process (or
    ftp or rxvt process) using the Task Manager and try again.
  Make sure your machine has enough disk space - I'd start with the largest
    open space on any of your partitions.
  Make sure your machine has networking (IP, gateway, etc.) so you can use
    ftp to get to dumbo.


Step 1: Install Visual C++ (v6.0)
  - On WinNT, you will be prompted to register environment variables for
    running the compiler from the command line - do it.
  - I also recommend installing the full MSDN Library documentation.
  - Make sure you install the latest service pack by running:
       \\dimbo\panda\msvc-sp5\setupsp5.exe

Step 2: Install Cygwin (v1.0)
  - Install Cygwin from the cd  
  - Open up a shell by running (and, if you desire, creating a shortcut to)
    tcsh.exe in: 
       C:/Cygwin/contrib/bin 
    Alternately, you can run a bash shell by going to the "Start"
    button at the bottom left of your screen, selecting "Programs",
    "Cygwin" and "bash".  You can then run "tcsh" at the bash prompt to make 
    things easier.  
  - Set up the Cygwin environment:
    - Check for directories /bin /etc /tmp /usr and create them using 
      mkdir if they don't exist.  
    - Make the following directories:
      > mkdir /c /f /g /h /i /j /v
      > mkdir /msvc98
      > mkdir /mscommon
      > mkdir /usr/local
      > mkdir /usr/local/bin
      > mkdir /usr/local/etc
    - Create some links expected by the attach scripts:
      > ln -s /contrib/bin/tcsh /bin/csh
      > ln -s /contrib/bin/perl /usr/local/bin/perl
      > ln -s /bin/bash /usr/local/bin/bash
    - Connect the network drives:
      > net use f: "\\nufat\fat" /persistent:yes
      > net use g: "\\nufat\bit" /persistent:yes
      > net use h: "\\dimbo\usr2" /persistent:yes
      > net use i: "\\nufat\big" /persistent:yes
      > net use j: "\\nufat\for" /persistent:yes
      > net use v: "\\dimbo\panda" /persistent:yes
    - Mount directories.  Note the use of -b for the unix mounts. The
      VC++ mounts assume VC++ was installed in C:\Program Files:
      > mount -s c:/ /c
      > mount -s -b f:/ /f
      > mount -s -b g:/ /g
      > mount -s -b h:/ /h
      > mount -s -b i:/ /i
      > mount -s -b j:/ /j
      > mount -s -b v:/ /v
      > mount -s C:/Program\ Files/Microsoft\ Visual\ Studio/VC98 /msvc98
      > mount -s C:/Program\ Files/Microsoft\ Visual\ Studio/Common /mscommon
    - These are optional, but handy
      > mkdir /fat
      > mkdir /bit
      > mkdir /fit
      > mkdir /ful
      > mkdir /alpha
      > mkdir /beta
      > mkdir /gamma
      > mkdir /for
      > mount -s -b F:/ /fat
      > mount -s -b G: /bit
      > mount -s -b H:/fit/ /fit
      > mount -s -b H:/ful/ /ful
      > mount -s -b I:/alpha/ /alpha
      > mount -s -b I:/beta /beta
      > mount -s -b I:/gamma /gamma
      > mount -s -b J:/ /for

Step 3: Create your home directory
  - Create a HOME directory:
    > mkdir /usr/<yourname>
  - Create/copy necessary files: .cshrc, .emacs, Configrc, Config.pp
  - Set the $HOME environment variable:
    - On WinNT use the Registry:
      - Select "My Computer" icon from the desktop.
      - Select "Control Panel" icon.
      - Select "System" icon.
      - Select "Environment" tab.
      - Create the variable "HOME" with the value "/usr/<yourname>".
      - click ok - ok - ok to exit (you must exit for the change to take 
        effect)
      - Now open a new shell to get the changes.
    - On Win98 use AUTOEXEC.BAT:
      - Add/Change the "HOME=/usr/<yourname>" line in C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT:
      - Note: if you want to edit your existing AUTOEXEC.BAT, you need
        to use "edit.exe" in order to generate the correct "newline"
        character (^M).
    - Note: We've seen a problem where we can't source ~/.cshrc if the home
      directory /usr/<yourname> does not match the user name exactly. 
      To be safe, be sure and name your home directory to be /usr/<yourname>.

Step 4: Update /usr/local/etc:
  - Copy vspec files from $WINTOOLS to /usr/local/etc
    > cd V:/win/install/wintools
    > cp_vspec 
  - Copy Config.pp from $WINTOOLS to /usr/local/etc
    > cp V:/win/install/wintools/panda/etc/Config.pp /usr/local/etc/.
  - (Optional) Add new username to vspec files
    - If you are setting up a new user, edit the *.vspec files
      in /usr/local/etc to reflect the new username and path to the player
      tree.  
    - Also edit (on the SGI, for instance on dumbo) the file 
      /fit/cvs/CVSROOT/passwd to add the new username as a valid user of
      CVS.
  - (Optional) Update default values in vspec files
    - Edit appropriate *.vspec files to specify which trees you wish to use
      as a default (e.g. install vs. minstall vs. personal)

Step 5: Grab the cvs trees
  - Open a new shell
  - Create personal trees:
    > cd ~
    > mkdir player
    > cd player
    # Just hit return when prompted for a password
    > cvs login
    > cvs co dtool (only if local dtool will be built)
    > cvs co panda (only if local panda will be built)
    > cvs co direct (only if local direct will be built)
    > cvs co toontown (only if local toontown will be built)
  - Choose which optimize level you want. This is set in
      /usr/local/etc/Config.pp
    or in the Config.pp in your $HOME directory (overides /usr/local/etc file)
    Look for #define OPTIMIZE and follow instructions above that.
    You can only choose an arbitrary optimize level if you are building
    your own DTOOL and PANDA; otherwise, you must set it to the optimize
    level corresponding to the version of DTOOL/PANDA you intend to attach
    to (install is built OPTIMIZE 2, release is built OPTIMIZE 3).

Step 6: (Optional) Build $DTOOL
  - Now you must use the tcsh shortcut to open a new shell - it should attach
    to $DTOOL:install automatically, but you will need to attach to your
    own DTOOL if you want to build your own.
    > cta dtool personal
    > cd $DTOOL
    > ppremake
    > nmake install

Step 7: (Optional) Install DirectX
  - Install DirectX 7.0 (by default into C:\mssdk).  You need this to
    successfully build all of panda.

Step 8: (Optional) Build $PANDA 
  - Build panda
    > cta panda personal
    > cd $PANDA
    > ppremake
    > nmake install
  - You can now run "demo" to test the install and build - you should
    see a window pop up with a triangle in it.  To see the triangle with
    a texture on it, you'll need to be in $PANDA/src/all/testbed/ when
    you run "demo".

Step 9: Install Emacs
  - get the tarball from /for/program/tarballs/emacs-20.7-fullbin-i386.tar.gz 
  - untar/install (This will install emacs into C:/emacs-20.7, 
    do not attempt to install it under a directory containing a space,
    like "Program Files".)
    > cd /c
    > tar xvzf ~/emacs-20.7-fullbin-i386.tar.gz
  - Copy lisp/script files
    > cp $DIRECT/src/directscripts/python-mode.el /c/emacs-20.7/lisp/progmodes
    > cp $DIRECT/src/directscripts/runPythonEmacs /usr/local/bin
  - Update environment variables (win2000).  Note: You should only need to
    do this if you intend to invoke Panda from a non-Cygwin prompt.  If you
    will always be using Cygwin, simply edit your .cshrc file to extend the
    path appropriately. 
    - right click on your computer icon at the top left of the screen
    - select "properties"
    - click on the "Advanced" tab
    - click on "Environment Variables..."
    - double click on the "Path" variable in the bottom pane (system variables)
    - add  C:\emacs-20.7\bin  to the end of the path (semicolon separated)
    - click ok - ok - ok to exit (you must exit for the change to take effect)

Step 10: Build $DIRECT
  > cta direct personal
  > cd $DIRECT
  > ppremake
  > nmake install

Step 11: Build $TOONTOWN
  > cta toontown personal
  > cd $TOONTOWN
  > ppremake
  > nmake install

Step 12: Generate Python Code
  > cd $DIRECT/bin
  > ppython generatePythonCode
  # Follow instructions presented there
