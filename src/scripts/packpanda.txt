Panda includes a program, 'packpanda', that packages up
a panda game into a convenient redistributable.  If you are
not using 'packpanda,' you can delete the NSIS subdirectory.

NSIS is the "Netscape Scriptable Install System."  It is
a general-purpose tool for building executable windows
installers.  "Packpanda" is built on top of NSIS.  Again,
if you're not using packpanda, you don't need NSIS.

Note that this is a stripped-down version of NSIS, containing
only the files that panda needs.  You can get a much more
featureful version of NSIS from http://nsis.sourceforge.net
